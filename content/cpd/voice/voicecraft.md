<p><b>Description:</b>
Voicecraft® is an evidence-based system of knowledge and skills which facilitates the restoration and optimisation of the voice. It is comprised of a collection of voice analysis, voice manipulation and habitual vocal change skills and processes based on a wide body of research by the great voice scientists and practitioners of the last and current century: G. Paul Moore, Ingo Titze, Johan Sundberg, Harry Hollien, Christy Ludlow, Jo Estill, William Vennard and many, many others. These skills are applied to the re-organisation and optimisation of the disordered or sub-optimal voice. Application to is guided by a set of principles that underpin all aspects of Voicecraft®.
