<p><b>Description:</b>
In clinical practice, many speech pathologists feel ill-equipped to diagnose and treat cluttering. This Clinical Bite provides information about how to identify and determine treatment targets for cluttering and demonstrates the clinical application of treatment for different clients.
</p>

<p>Upon successful completion of this workshop, participants will be able to:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>identify clients with cluttered speech</li>
<li>understand why diagnosis of cluttering might be overlooked and apply an appropriate assessment battery for its identification</li>
<li>advocate for a communication-centred treatment approach that involves both the listener and speaker</li>
<li>design individualised treatment for cluttering clients</li>
</ul>
