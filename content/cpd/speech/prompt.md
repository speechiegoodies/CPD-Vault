<p><b>Description:</b>
PROMPT is widely accepted as a treatment method for children ages 6 months and older who may have autism, apraxia, dysarthria, cerebral palsy, or other motor speech disorders. The PROMPT method centers on a tactile-kinesthetic approach to speech therapy. To become PROMPT Certified, a clinician must complete four essential steps to be able to fully understand the PROMPT technique and apply it appropriately to clients/patients. All PROMPT training begins with the Intro workshop which may be taken in-person, online through Zoom, or via ten online modules.</p>
